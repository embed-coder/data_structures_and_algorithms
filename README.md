## NOTE: 
- In order to use Cmake, please ammend CMakeList.txt file apropriate
- In VSCode, select Ctrl + Shift + P -> Build and Debug the active file for debugging each of file with C++ extension installed
- Because gitignore will ignore any files without extension. The filename should contain only 1 dot to avoid building out a binary file with a dot in the name and confusing the gitignore mechanism
